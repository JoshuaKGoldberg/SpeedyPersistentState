# PersistentSpeedyState

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is the companion code for the [Speedy Expo Apps with Persistent Redux State](https://swmansion.com/academy/webinars/josh-goldberg-speedy-expo-apps-with-persistent-redux-state) webinar.

> React Native components can receive data from all sorts of places.
> Particularly complex applications using Redux have become notorious for confusing data flows and hierarchies.
> This webinar will go over how to structure your React Native application to use redux-persistâ€™s persistent data storage.
> Josh will then go on to show the benefits of using popular open source libraries: popular documentation, knowledge transferability, and easy cross-library integrations.
